Hello, World! 👋

I am an incoming M.S. student at Seoul National University, specializing in Artificial Intelligence. My primary research focus is on developing realistic continual learning methods for large models. The areas I am currently exploring include:

- 🤖 Developing continual learning methods using generative models in situations without manually annotated data.
- 📈 Proposing concept-incremental continual learning methods during the personalization process of T2I models.
- 🔍 Creating realistic benchmarks for vision-language models under continual domain shift scenarios.


📫 How to reach me: Feel free to contact me at seongwoncho@snu.ac.kr if you’d like to collaborate on research or if you have any questions.
